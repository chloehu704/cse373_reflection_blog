        <h2>How has my understanding of CS changed?</h2>
        <p>In previous courses, I was introduced to projects like Huffman Coding.
            The specification of those projects are very different from the specification we
            have for projects in cse373. We will using Huffman Coding as an example to analyze 
            how different specification in cs courses impact the way students understand the work
            they do.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I.</strong> Priority Queue is only one of the many ways to implement Huffman Coding.
            We want to build a tree that stores that frequency of each character. This can also
            be accomplished by binary search tree or binary heaps. Considering the fact that
            later on we want to traverse the tree and read off the information stored in the 
            tree, binary search tree might be more intuitive and easier to implement than priority queue.
            Looking back, knowing why we choose to implement a specification in particular way is a crucial step 
            for developers to have a high-level understanding  of the project we are involved in. We are 
            not merely writing codes according to guidelines, we are using code to achieve the impact we 
            want to create.
        </p>
        <p><strong>II.</strong> Throughout the quarter of cse373, we use various ways to analyze 
            and compare the program we finished. We employs experimental analysis, affordance analysis, 
            and asymptotic analysis. In previous courses, the analysis of program is not strongly emphasized. 
            Usually, when a program is successfully running, we will call it a day and go submit it. We 
            would rarely think beyond the program itself. In cse373, we perform asymptotic analysis to compare 
            different implementation methods in different contexts. Then we use experimental analysis to analyze the difference between
            theoretical runtime and runtime in realtity to discuss factors like memory that influence the program other than
            the implementation itself. Most importantly, affordance analysis introduced in this class encourages us
            think about what kind of impact our program might bring to people and the society. To become a real 
            developer, examining our program with different perspectives put us in a spot that we are more likely 
            to think outside of our work and how it is related and connected to the world we all live in.
        </p>
        <p><strong>II.</strong> Critique and connect part in cse373 prompts us to examine our program by    situating us in a much broader landscape. It forces us to think beyond the limited scope we have in class. If our program is not a class assignment, instead it is a application used by or upon millions of people, what will happen? Those are the questions we need to ask ourselves.

        <h2>What part of the course most changed you?</h2>
        <p>
            The part of cse373 that changes me the most is its emphasis on understanding of what we do. As I mentioned above, my previous experiences in other cs courses put strong emphasis on making the program run and writing good code, which are very important as well. However, before and after we write our code, there are steps skipped in those courses, which is understanding what we are trying to achieve, how we want to implement it, and what impact it brings. Those processes are as crucial as writing code and checking our code quality. There is one time when I struggled to implement the project. I have no idea how I can make this work. After I spend around 1.5 hours connecting all the dots and drafting a pretty solid understanding of the problem I am trying to solve, I spent 20 mins to write all the codes that successfully make the program run. The moment of satisfaction is unforgettable.

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
            I will become a TA for cse373 next quarter! This is the next step I want to take after having all the amazing experiences in the class. Now it is time to give back to the community. I am really excited to start this journey.
