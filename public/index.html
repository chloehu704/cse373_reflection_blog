        <h2>How has my understanding of CS changed?</h2>
        <p>In previous courses, I was introduced to projects like Huffman Coding.
            The specification of those projects are very different from the specification we
            have for projects in cse373. We will using Huffman Coding as an example to analyze 
            how different specification in cs courses impact the way students understand the work
            they do.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I.</strong> Priority Queue is only one of the many ways to implement Huffman Coding.
            We want to build a tree that stores that frequency of each character. This can also
            be accomplished by binary search tree or binary heaps. Considering the fact that
            later on we want to traverse the tree and read off the information stored in the 
            tree, binary search tree might be more intuitive and easier to implement than priority queue.
            Looking back, knowing why we choose to implement a specification in particular way is a crucial step 
            for developers to have a high-level understanding  of the project we are involved in. We are 
            not merely writing codes according to guidelines, we are using code to achieve the impact we 
            want to create.
        </p>
        <p><strong>II.</strong> Throughout the quarter of cse373, we use various ways to analyze 
            and compare the program we finished. We employs experimental analysis, affordance analysis, 
            and asymptotic analysis. In previous courses, the analysis of program is not strongly emphasized. 
            Usually, when a program is successfully running, we will call it a day and go submit it. We 
            would rarely think beyond the program itself. In cse373, we perform asymptotic analysis to compare 
            different implementation methods in different contexts. Then we use experimental analysis to analyze the difference between
            theoretical runtime and runtime in realtity to discuss factors like memory that influence the program other than
            the implementation itself. Most importantly, affordance analysis introduced in this class encourages us
            think about what kind of impact our program might bring to people and the society. To become a real 
            developer, examining our program with different perspectives put us in a spot that we are more likely 
            to think outside of our work and how it is related and connected to the world we all live in.

        <p><strong>II.</strong> Doing the critique and connect part keeps us humble. When we
